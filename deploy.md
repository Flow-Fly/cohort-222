> ## [Create an account on heroku](https://signup.heroku.com/)

> ## [Download the HEROKU CLI](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli)

> ## [Log-in to heroku](https://id.heroku.com/login)

## Go to your dashboard

- Click on create New App and create you application, select the name of your application carefully
- Go into the settings and search for Config Vars
- Reveal them and all of your environment variables except for :
  - your PORT variable
  - your `MONGO_URI` variable (We will add it after)
- Once done, add your `MONGO_URI`, it should be the string we saved from Mongo Atlas earlier, be sure that your password is actually displayed.

## Connect your repository to Heroku

- Use `heroku login` in your terminal, it will open up your browser and let you connect.
- Once done, from your terminal inside of your project directory use `heroku git:remote -a <The-name-of-your-app>`.
- Check if everything went right using `git remote -v`, you should see 2 remotes named `origin` and 2 named `heroku`.
- Push your code to heroku using `git push heroku`

> When working on your project, you should keep pushing to your github, using the workflow seen together. Once your code is ready, you can push it to Heroku

## Usefull Heroku commands

- `heroku logs --tail` allow you to print the received requests and errors happening in the server, usefull to debug your live application if you can't reproduce the error locally!

## Executing your seed from heroku

- To access the heroku shell in your remote server, run `heroku run bash` after a few seconds you will be remotely in your server and able to run you seed using `node <your-seed>/<path.js>`
