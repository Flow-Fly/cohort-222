## Deployments issues 😨

- Sometime there is an issue in deployment and the deploy fails

> Try to fix the issues locally

You can test the build process locally by running `npm run build` in your frontend directory.
When the issue is fixed, deploy again!

Go to the **Deploys** Tab, click on **Trigger deploy** and **Deploy site**

## Add your environment variables

- Go to the Site settings, then in the build and deploy, click on environment and add your backend url (The heroku url).

## React router problems

If you navigate to a page away from the root route and then refresh, you'll encounter an error page.

The fix is relatively simple.
Netlify needs to know that it should redirect traffic to any of your routes onto the `index.html` page, where React is loaded and will handle it.

create a file named `_redirects` (no extension needed) in the `/public` folder.
in the `/public/_redirects` file, write `/* /index.html 200`

Add this file to git and push it!

## CORS

Cross Origin Resource Sharing

You now have your website in two places, e.g. funky-web.herokuapp.com and funky-web.netlify.app. Modern web browsers will block a JSON request from a frontend unless the backend matches the origin, or if the origin is specified as allowed.

Be sure to add your `ORIGIN` environment variable to your backend in heroku!

## Treating warnings as errors

Netlify will treat any warning it sees on the console as an Error and will fail the build process.

Two solutions for that:

- Have no warnings in the console!
- Go to the build settings ![alt](https://i.imgur.com/sP6rq8z.png)

Change the build command to `CI=false npm run build`
