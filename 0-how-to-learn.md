# Notes on how to learn

For a lot of us, a bootcamp like this is the first time we've been in education since school or university.

Sounds strange, but we may have forgotten how to learn.

## Notes

Take notes.

One of the **most important things** about note taking is **the act of taking them**.
You might find that you remember things _because_ you wrote them down.

Sometime, you might only remember that you wrote them down. Great! You'll go back to look at them.

## Bridges

I think about learning in terms of bridges.

If you want to send a freight train across a river, you first need to send something much, much smaller.

This was the case with the first Niagara Falls bridge, built in 1848.
A boat couldn't cross because of the rapids before the waterfall.
There were no helicopters handy, and aeroplanes weren't invented.
No crane existed with span enough to traverse the bridge, if any existed at all.

What did they do?

They held a kite-flying contest. Whoever could fly a kite and land it on the other shore would win five dollars.
When the kite had landed, they tied it down, and used its string to send across more string, and more, then wires, then thicker wires; until heavy cables could be sent.

Eventually, that was enough to have a passenger/goods cable car — the first of its kind.

Once you can pass cables, you can build a bridge.
You build a small bridge.
You create a walkway across it.

You move more materials across, you use the first bridge as a scaffold for the next bridge.
You repeatedly increase the size of that bridge until it's ready for heavy loads.

In 1855, they sent a steam locomotive across, seven years after the kite string.

You have to start small, you have to go back over again and again, until eventually you've built something strong and enduring.

## Questions

When you have questions, ask them.

It's important when learning to be as conscient as possible about what you understand, and what you don't.
Don't be afraid to interrogate yourself.

## Perspective

Keep looking back at where you were a few days ago, the last week or even a few months back.

What do you know now? What seemed hard then which seems easy now?

You're going to be moving at such a fast pace that it will feel like you're always climbing up the hill. You are! Just don't forget to **look how far you've come** once in a while.

This is why we're here: to keep on running up that hill.

## The Valley of Despair

There's an unpleasant sensation between knowing nothing about a subject and being a master of it: despair.

Usually, when you're feeling like you really don't understand something,
you're at the point of understanding it much better than you knew was possible.

It goes like this:

1. We don't know what we don't know
2. We know what we don't know
3. We know what we know
4. We don't know what we know

Otherwise known as the [four stages of competence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_stages_of_competence):

1. Unconscious incompetence
2. Conscious incompetence
3. Conscious competence
4. Unconscious competence

You feel the most **despair** when you're at the point of knowing just how much you don't know.
This passes, usually quickly.
Push through it; be conscious of it.
